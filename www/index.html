<h2>EchoPoint Component Library</h2>

<p>EchoPoint component library for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo3'>NextApp Echo3</a> web
application framework.  This project is a re-implementation of the
<a href='http://docs.rakeshv.org/java/echopointng/'>EchoPointNG</a> library
created by Brad Baker for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo2'>NextApp Echo2</a> web
application framework.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p><a href='http://echopoint.sourceforge.net/'>EchoPoint</a> was created by
Brad Baker as a rich component library for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo1'>Echo1</a>.  The project was
later re-implemented as EchoPointNG for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo2'>Echo2</a> by Brad.  Brad has
stopped work on EchoPoint due to time and family constraints.</p>

<p>This project has been started by a team of EchoPointNG users who wish
to continue to use the extensive component library developed by Brad.
No further work on EchoPointNG is planned, however an new component library
that replicates most of the common components of EchoPointNG for
<a href='http://echo.nextapp.com/site/echo3'>Echo3</a>
framework will be developed.</p>

<p>Echo has changed quite radically from version 
2 to 3 in that most component rendering is done in pure JavaScript on the
client-side, thus reducing the server-side resource utilisation of Echo
applications.  A regular port of EchoPointNG is hence not possible, and
requires total rewrite of the rendering peers for all components.</p>

<h3>Source Code</h3>

The sources for the re-implementation work as well as the original
EchoPointNG may be checked out from the project

    <li>Note that it is not recommended that users use the <code>trunk</code>
    area since the status of the sources are likely to be unstable and not
    entirely tested.  The <code>trunk</code> area is primarily for the use
    of developers involved with implementing the library.  It is recommended
    that users use the latest version from the <code>tags</code> area.
